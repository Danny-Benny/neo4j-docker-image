README: Setting up Neo4j

To set up Neo4j, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker if you haven't already.
2. Create a docker-compose.yml file with the following content:

        version: '3'
        services:
            neo4j:
                image: neo4j:latest
                ports:
                    - 7474:7474
                    - 7687:7687
                environment:
                    - NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the docker-compose.yml file.
4. Run the following command to start Neo4j:

        docker-compose up

5. Wait for the Neo4j container to start. You can check the logs for progress.
6. Once the container is running, open Neo4j Desktop.
7. Click on "Add Graph" and select "Connect to Remote Graph".
8. Enter the following details:

        - Host: localhost
        - Bolt Port: 7687
        - Username: neo4j
        - Password: password

9. Click on "Connect" to establish a connection to the Neo4j database.

Now you are ready to use Neo4j with your application!

Note: Make sure to replace "password" with your desired password in the docker-compose.yml file and the Neo4j Desktop connection details.
