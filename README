README: Setting up Neo4j with Docker
To set up Neo4j using Docker, follow these steps:

Install Docker:

If you haven't already installed Docker, you can download it from Docker's official website.
Create a Docker Compose File:

Create a docker-compose.yml file in your project directory with the following content:
yaml
Copy code
version: "3.8"
services:
  neo4j:
    image: neo4j:latest
    ports:
      - 7888:7474
      - 7999:7687
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      NEO4J_AUTH: neo4j/password
    volumes:
      - ./db/data:/data
      - ./db/logs:/logs
      - ./db/conf:/conf
      - ./db/plugins:/plugins
Start Neo4j Container:

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the docker-compose.yml file.
Run the following command to start Neo4j:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
Wait for Neo4j to Start:

Allow some time for the Neo4j container to start. You can monitor the progress by checking the logs.
Access Neo4j Desktop:

Once the container is running, open Neo4j Desktop.
Click on "Add Graph" and select "Connect to Remote Graph."
Enter Connection Details:

Enter the following details:
Host: localhost
Bolt Port: 7687 (or the port you specified in the docker-compose.yml file)
Username: neo4j
Password: password (replace with your desired password)
Connect to Neo4j:

Click on "Connect" to establish a connection to the Neo4j database.
Now you are ready to use Neo4j with your application!

Note:

Ensure to replace "password" with your desired password in both the docker-compose.yml file and the Neo4j Desktop connection details.
If you've changed the port mappings, update the Neo4j Desktop connection details accordingly.
